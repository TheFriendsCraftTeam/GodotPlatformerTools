# Godot platformer tools :wrench:

## What?
This is an addon for the Godot game engine, made by @DaylightDr3amer and thought to make the creation of 2D games (especially platformers) easier and quicker, without loosing control.

## WAIT!!
This addon (as you can probably see) is current in development version and it's not meant to be used in any game (for now), but if you just want to give it a look and maybe add you own stuff I won't stop you. :wink:
## Some features

### Planned:
- [ ] Level management **30%**
